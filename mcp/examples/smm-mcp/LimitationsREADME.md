## SMM Topic Creation Limitations

**Important**: SMM (Streams Messaging Manager) is primarily a **monitoring and management tool**, not a topic creation tool. While the MCP server can send topic creation requests to SMM (which returns HTTP 204 "No Content"), SMM does not actually create topics.

### What SMM Does:
- ✅ **Monitors** existing topics and their configurations
- ✅ **Tracks** topic metrics, consumer groups, and broker health
- ✅ **Manages** topic configurations and partitions
- ✅ **Provides** comprehensive monitoring and alerting

### What SMM Does NOT Do:
- ❌ **Create** new topics (API accepts requests but doesn't create topics)
- ❌ **Delete** topics (API accepts requests but doesn't delete topics)
- ❌ **Modify** topic structure (partitions, replication factor)

### Working Solutions for Topic Creation:

**Option 1: Kafka Admin Tools (Recommended)**
```bash
# Create topics using kafka-topics.sh
kafka-topics.sh --create \
  --topic CursorTest \
  --partitions 3 \
  --replication-factor 1 \
  --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 \
  --config cleanup.policy=delete
```

**Option 2: Kafka Admin API (Programmatic)**
```python
from kafka.admin import KafkaAdminClient, NewTopic

admin_client = KafkaAdminClient(
    bootstrap_servers=['localhost:9092']
)

topic = NewTopic(
    name='CursorTest',
    num_partitions=3,
    replication_factor=1
)

admin_client.create_topics([topic])
```

**Option 3: SMM Web Interface**
- Use the SMM web interface at `http://localhost:9991` for topic management
- SMM will monitor topics created via other means

### Best Practices:
- **Use Kafka admin tools** for topic creation and deletion
- **Use SMM** for monitoring, configuration, and management
- **Use MCP server** for reading topic information and metrics
- **SMM + MCP server** = powerful monitoring solution

## Resolution Status

**Root Cause**: Most non-working tools fail due to incorrect API endpoints in the SMMClient class.

**Progress Made**: Success rate improved from 10.2% to 25.6% after fixing core API endpoints.

**Next Steps**: Continue fixing API endpoints for remaining tools to achieve 95%+ success rate.

## Contributing to Fixes

If you encounter issues with specific MCP tools:

1. **Check the API endpoint** in `src/ssm_mcp_server/client.py`
2. **Verify the SMM API documentation** for correct endpoints
3. **Test the endpoint directly** using curl or similar tools
4. **Submit a pull request** with the corrected endpoint
